# Person Hierarchy Design - Java

## Class Structure

### Person
- Driver
- Manager

### Attributes
- name
- age
- dob
- Address

### Behaviour
- doEat
- doSleep
- doWork

## Why Not Make Person Abstract with an Abstract doWork()?

The initial design used a concrete Person class with a generic doWork() implementation.  
Here's why an abstract Person class with abstract doWork() is a better approach for this specific scenario, along with best practices:

### 1. Problem with the Initial Design

**Generic doWork() is meaningless**:  
A "generic person" doesn't have a work behavior.  
The problem states a person must be either a Driver or Manager, so forcing subclasses to define doWork() is more logical.

**Prevents misuse**:  
Without abstraction, someone might accidentally instantiate a generic Person (which violates the requirement).

---

### 3. Best Practice: When to Use Abstract Classes/Methods

**Use abstraction when**:  
-> The base class should not be instantiated directly (e.g., Person is too generic).  
-> Subclasses must implement specific behaviors (e.g., doWork() is role-specific).  
-> You want to enforce a contract (subclasses can‚Äôt compile without implementing abstract methods).

**Avoid abstraction when**:  
-> The base class has complete/default implementations of all methods.  
-> You need to instantiate the base class directly.

---

### 4. Key Advantages of This Approach

**Enforces Correctness**:  
Subclasses must define doWork(), preventing accidental use of a generic implementation.

**Clarity**:  
Clearly communicates that Person is a conceptual entity, not a concrete role.

**Polymorphism**:  
Still supports `Person driver = new Driver(...);` and `driver.doWork();`

**Future-Proof**:  
Adding new roles (e.g., Engineer) requires implementing doWork().

# Java Serialization ‚Äì Complete Guide & Interview Notes

This guide covers everything you need to understand and revise **Serialization in Java**, including theory, practical examples, behavior of special fields, JSON alternatives, and real-world use cases.

## üìå What is Serialization?

**Serialization** is the process of converting a Java object into a **byte stream** so it can be:
- Saved to a file or database
- Sent over a network
- Stored in memory or cache
- Transferred between JVMs

**Deserialization** is the reverse: converting the byte stream back into a Java object.

---

## ‚úÖ Why Use Serialization?

- Persist object state (e.g., save/load from file or DB)
- Send objects across a network (e.g., in distributed systems)
- Deep clone objects
- Store cached object data
- Communicate between JVMs

---

## üõ† How to Implement Serialization

### Step 1: Implement `java.io.Serializable`

```java
public class Employee implements Serializable {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
    
    private String name;
    private String empId;
    private LocalDate dob;
    private Address address;
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è What Happens with `static` Fields?

**Question:** What happens if `empId` is `static` in a `Serializable` class?  

**Answer:**  
‚û§ **Static fields are not serialized ‚Äî always.**  

‚ùì **Why?**  
Because:
- `static` fields belong to the **class**, not the **instance**
- Serialization only saves the state of **object instances** ‚Äî not the class itself

```java
private static String empId;  // Never serialized
